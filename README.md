# Umeskia Chat Bot

To create a chatbot with PHP, you will first need to install PHP on your system and set up a development environment. You can then use the PHP programming language to create a chatbot by using various libraries and frameworks that are available.

To create a chatbot with PHP, you will need to follow these steps:

Install PHP on your system and set up a development environment.

Choose a PHP framework or library to use for your chatbot. Some popular options include Laravel, Symfony, and Botman.

Create a new PHP project using the chosen framework or library.

Define the logic and functionality of your chatbot by writing PHP code.

Test your chatbot to ensure it is working as expected.

Here is an example of how you can create a simple chatbot with PHP using the Botman framework:

```php

// Include the Botman library
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

// Create a new Botman instance
$botman = BotmanFactory::create();

// Define a greeting message for the chatbot
$botman->hears('hello', function($bot) {
  $bot->reply('Hi there! How can I help you?');
});

// Run the chatbot
$botman->listen();

```
This code creates a new chatbot using the Botman framework and defines a greeting message that the chatbot will respond with when it receives the message "hello". You can add more functionality and logic to your chatbot by defining additional hears() and reply() statements in your PHP code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
